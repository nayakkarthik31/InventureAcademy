A Teacher Leader programme is also in place for people managers. Apart from the inhouse training programmes, teachers also attend several workshops conducted by the different boards of education like CISCE and CIE and international conferences like the 21st Century Learning Conference, Round Square Conference etc.</p>

One that gently brings them in tune with themselves, their peers and their environment. That seamlessly integrates progressive theories of education with our Core Values, and celebrates the rich and varied way children learn.They have time for reflection and journal writing. Every activity is designed carefully to evolve attitudes and advance personal skills, spark curiosity and get children to ask questions which may have no ready answers.Inventuring produces outcomes where children learn to discover themselves, their strengths, mindsets and fears. Where they begin to think and understand how they learn and engage with their world; and where they nurture their love for nature and their community. They learn how to work collaboratively. Their attitudes begin to evolve, their personal skills blossom. Observation, research, communication, investigation and higher order thinking get sharpened, all of this forming the foundation of their approach to life and learning in the years to come. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>

Students can win positive points for their House; however the sense of competition is overridden by a collaborative culture where students from different Houses support each other, play fair, and are gracious in victory and defeat. A House Championship is decided at the end of the year. A sense of belonging, leadership qualities and team skills flower in this system.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
